# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data - Final project - Run analysis on Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set 

Code Structure :
  # Step 1 - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  
  #### 1. read training data  
  
  #### 2. merge training data

  #### 3. read test data  
  
  #### 4. merge training data

  #### 5. bind training and test data
  
  # Step 2 - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  
  #### 1. import the features
  
  #### 2. select the list of features

  #### 3. extract desired data

  # Step 3 - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

  #### 1. import the activity names

  #### 2. merge activity_labels with dataset

  # Step 4 - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  
  #### 1. import the activity names

  #### 2. create a new dataset (dataSet4) to change the name of the columns

  #### 3. change names

  # Step 5 - From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
  
  #### 1. exclude columns to simplify the 

  #### 2. compute the value we want by subject and nature of activity

  #### 3. supress redundancy

  #### 4. reintegrate activity labels

  #### 5. export to txt file
